I tried multiple hours to set up my work, but I got so many errors, I could not get further than the first step.
But I really tried and even though I attend all the lectures and followed the coding proccess, I was not able to solve my errors and I gave up after a lot of hours trying without success.
I still added my project here, just so you could see that I tried.
I was able to set up Jenkins in the lecture, so I added screenshot from it.
